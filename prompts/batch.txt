My goal is to create a detailed but accurate set of questions and answers from each image. 
The purpose is to create an automated visual commonsense reasoning dataset. Pretend that you are a human thinking of questions and answers that require reasoning. 
Only ask questions that can be answered using information in the image. Do not ask simple questions that can be answered without reasoning.
Output a list in JSON where each element is a list of 7 question/answer pairs for the corresponding image. Label questions as "question" and answers as "answer".
