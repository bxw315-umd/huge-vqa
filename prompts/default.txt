My goal is to create a detailed but accurate set of questions and answers from the image. The purpose is to create an automated VQA dataset. Pretend that you are a human thinking of questions and answers. Make sure some questions require reasoning to answer. For instance, if there is an image of a waitress bringing food to a table, a customer might be pointing at another costumer to indicate that it's their food. Create around 7 Q/A pairs. Provide your Q/A pairs in JSON format.
